## Responsibility

This directory holds the **workflow skill family** — nine skills that codify how the agent should
*run a piece of work* — plus the `specrail-spec-graph` skill (graph mechanics), which sits outside the
family. This spec is the family's **meta-layer** — the concept model, the three skill roles, and the
meta-rules that govern every workflow skill here. It is the authoritative *why*; the
`specrail-writing-workflow-skills` skill carries the actionable authoring checklist and points back
here (its "(rule N)" citations are the meta-rules below). Packaging and delivery — how these skills
reach a consumer repo's assistant directories — live with the CLI's distribution design, not in the
skill bodies: `specrail init` / `specrail sync`, governed by the `.specrail/config.json` manifest.

Provenance: designed in the source project's (since retired) workflow-system task-spec, researched
against obra/superpowers, gsd-build/gsd-2, Anthropic's skill-authoring guidance, and a real-world v1
workflow system — whose workflows are an *example* of a possible future complex workflow, not a
template. Ported into specrail: skill names carry the `specrail-` prefix and host-specific references
were dropped or neutralized; the repo's `NOTICE` carries the attribution.

## Concept model

- **Workflow** — a repeatable way of running a piece of work, codified as one or more skills.
- **Workflow skill** — one skill = one *externally reachable* workflow *or one shared concept*;
  short, imperative, workflow-focused.
- **Sibling doc** — a file beside a skill's `SKILL.md` holding an internal workflow node (a branch,
  stage, or shared tail) or reference detail; named at the exact step that hands to it, read on
  demand, never discoverable on its own (rules 1 and 3).
- **Concept** — one topic's reusable rules, conventions, or mental model — shared ground the
  process skills stand on, codified as its own skill when more than one skill needs it.
- **Handoff** — the explicit, by-name transition at the end of a workflow skill, or a declared
  terminal state.
- **Gate** — a hard discipline point (e.g. "no implementation before the design is approved"),
  written with anti-rationalization notes, not soft advice.
- **Artifacts** — the **spec tree** (the durable record: decisions, contracts, limitations,
  principles — everything the code can't reveal) and **temp docs** (scaffolding for one piece of
  work: a task-spec and/or workflow-declared working files), governed by rules 8–9. The split is
  *lifecycle*, not file type — the task-spec lives in-graph while alive (`specrail create`) yet is a
  temp doc. Temp docs also have a designated *home*: the workspace's gitignored
  `.specrail/context/`, so they are live for the agent yet never reach the committed tree — durable
  content lands in the spec tree in place (rule 8).

## Skill roles & handoff contracts

Every workflow skill takes exactly one of **three roles**; everything richer is a *pattern* built from
them.

| Role | Body contains | Ends by |
|---|---|---|
| **Router** | classification rules + handoffs only | naming what runs next |
| **Worker** | one workflow's steps — in its body and its sibling docs | a handoff — fixed successor, back to its caller, or a terminal state (declared in the doc where the flow ends, rule 6) |
| **Concept** | one topic's reusable rules, conventions, or mental model — no steps, no routing | nothing — no ending section at all; control simply returns to its reader |

The **root router** is the single entry for new workflow-eligible work; one always-on rule — the
managed AGENTS.md block written by `specrail init --rule` — names those classes and points them at it.
Work already routed resumes its active workflow instead of re-entering the router. Branch skills may
route further (fractal routing).
A **concept** is not a process building block — routers and workers name it at the exact step that
needs it, and it is never a route: the router classifies *work*, and a concept is not work.

**Patterns** (vocabulary, not roles — no instances yet; for complex work):

- **Composer** — a *stateful router*: agrees a per-task pipeline with the user, records it in the
  task-spec's **Pipeline section** (checkboxes = plan + frontier + history), and walks it, adjusting as
  findings land; the workers it launches hand back to it. Its between-stage checking discipline is its
  own design, not a system rule. The family may hold several composers drawing on a shared pool of
  stages.
- **Stage** — any worker reached from a pipeline: upstream artifacts in, one artifact out, hands back
  to its caller. The same worker can also run standalone (fixed-successor/terminal handoff) —
  stage-ness is how a worker is *used*, not what it *is*.

No runtime machinery — the system is skills-only (no YAML pipelines, DAG tools, or stage sessions):
pipeline state is task-spec content; stage transitions are ordinary handoffs.

## Meta-rules

**Structure**
1. One *externally reachable* unit per skill — a workflow is one skill if it is reached only as a
   whole (routed to, called by another skill, or self-triggered); one topic per concept skill.
   **Skill boundaries follow external reachability, not workflow shape**: a workflow's internal shape
   — forks, branches, stages, joins, revise loops — lives in sibling docs, with the *choice rules
   staying in the doc (or spine) before the fork*. An internal doc is promoted to its own skill when
   it needs *independent addressability* — an external caller (another skill or a router), a genuine
   self-trigger, or a direct entry point (a slash command or direct entry): a single consumer can
   justify a skill when something outside the parent must reach it directly. Never promote for shape
   or size alone.
2. Routers route; workers work; concepts inform. A router contains classification rules + handoffs
   only — never a branch's steps; asking a question or inspecting the workspace *to classify* is
   routing, not work. A worker embeds no routing of *work* beyond its own ending — a fork among its
   own sibling docs (rule 1) is internal flow, not routing. A concept skill contains no steps and no handoffs; it may state norms about its topic, but *when*
   they are enforced belongs to the process skill that references it.
3. Skills are concise and workflow-focused: target < ~150 lines per file — the `SKILL.md` spine and
   each sibling doc alike. Sibling docs carry the workflow's internal nodes (rule 1) as well as
   reference detail, named in the exact step that hands to them (progressive disclosure); the spine
   carries the doc map, and each internal-node doc opens with a one-line contract: what is confirmed
   on entry, what it saves, where control goes next. Rules needed by a *second skill* are extracted
   into a concept skill — no premature extraction; within one skill's docs, shared content lives in
   one doc pointed at by the others.

**Discovery & entry**
4. At the start of a new piece of work, one always-on entry rule — the managed AGENTS.md block
   written by `specrail init --rule` — names the workflow-eligible classes — project onboarding and
   PR lifecycle work take precedence regardless of whether they edit code; other changes enter only
   when they require product or design decisions. The rule points only those classes at the root
   router. Work already routed resumes its active workflow; all other work proceeds directly without
   loading or announcing one.
   Skills are otherwise reached by routing/handoff, or — when the trigger is unmistakable — by a narrow
   self-trigger `description`: alongside a route (as `specrail-setting-up-a-project` does) or, for
   skills outside the router's work classification (meta/authoring skills), self-trigger alone (as
   `specrail-writing-workflow-skills` does). Concept skills are reached by name from the skill step
   that needs them and may add a narrow self-trigger; they never take a routing line (see the roles
   table — a concept is not work).
5. `description` = triggering conditions only ("Use when …"), never a summary of the workflow's steps
   — a step-summary tempts the agent to follow the description and skip the body.

**Chaining**
6. Explicit endings: every process skill ends by naming its successor skill or its terminal state —
   an internally forking worker (rule 1) ends by naming the sibling doc that continues the flow, and
   each internal doc ends the same way (next doc, return point, or the terminal state, declared in
   the doc where the flow actually ends); a concept skill has nothing to run next and writes no
   ending section — control simply returns to its reader. Cross-reference skills by name; never inline another skill's steps, never
   force-load another skill's files.
7. Say each thing once: a rule or step lives in exactly one skill; others point at it. A rule needed
   by more than one skill is extracted into a concept skill and pointed at, never copied.

**Artifacts**
8. The spec tree is the only durable record; how and when durable content reaches it is the
   workflow's call — written straight into the tree as decisions land (no temp doc at all), promoted
   incrementally from a task-spec as decisions settle, or promoted when the work lands. What never
   varies: durable content is in the tree before its temp doc is cleaned up, and there is no
   parallel durable plan/state format.
9. Temp docs are optional and belong to their workflow. When used, the task-spec is the default
   spine — design, plan, pipeline state, and review notes live as its sections; extra working files
   (resume state, scratch plans) are declared by naming their shape. **All temp docs live in the
   workspace's gitignored `.specrail/context/`** (zero git footprint, so they never reach the
   committed tree). The owning workflow also owns cleanup
   — delete when the work lands, by default; a temp doc never becomes the record.

**Scaling**
10. Scale by route and composition, not by prose: work that needs no workflow decision bypasses the
    router; the router sends eligible simple work down short paths; optional phases carry explicit
    "when to use / when to skip" criteria; complex work composes a per-task pipeline of stage workers.
    Depth lives in the route taken.
11. Gates where discipline matters, matching the form to the failure: prohibitions + red-flags for
    discipline violations; positive recipes for output shape.

**Maintenance**
12. Adding a workflow = add `skills/specrail-<name>/` + one routing line in the router that owns it —
    the root router by default, or the nearest sub-router when the skill is a branch under an
    already-routed workflow (fractal routing) — (self-trigger-only skills and concept skills per
    rule 4 skip the router line — a designed exception, never a size call) + one row in the family
    table below, including its **Routed from** entry. Nothing else changes shape.
13. The spec leads: system-shaping changes update this SPEC.md first; the authoring skill carries only
    the actionable checklist and points here for rationale.
14. Verify by use — **suspended: a known limitation, not currently a done-gate**. The intended rule:
    a new or changed skill isn't done until a real request has been observed flowing through it —
    for a concept, observed being loaded through a reference (or its self-trigger) and applied.
    What keeps the gate suspended: the skills ship as content into consumer repos, and no durable,
    shared record of observed runs exists to bind a done-gate to. Until then: unverified skills still
    ship as `active`, their verification debt is recorded honestly in the family table
    (`unverified by use`), and observed runs are still noted when they happen.

**Naming**
15. Names are verb-first, active voice, kebab-case (adopted from obra/superpowers' writing-skills
    guidance): gerunds for process skills (`specrail-choosing-a-workflow`,
    `specrail-setting-up-a-project`); a concept skill is named for its topic
    (`specrail-asking-user-questions`). Name the work the skill runs or the insight it carries —
    never the artifact it produces or the role that runs it. Directory name = frontmatter `name`
    (`skills/specrail-<name>/`, `name: specrail-<name>`).

## Workflow family

| Skill | Role — purpose | Routed from | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `specrail-brainstorming` | worker — decision-bearing change → validated task-spec | `specrail-choosing-a-workflow` (root) | active; unverified by use |
| `specrail-setting-up-a-project` | router (sub) — dispatcher: detect the workspace's state (specs present / empty / code-only) and route | `specrail-choosing-a-workflow` (root) + self-trigger + a direct entry point | active; unverified by use |
| `specrail-starting-a-new-project` | worker — inception interview (empty repo → goal-and-requirements) | `specrail-setting-up-a-project` + narrow self-trigger | active; unverified by use |
| `specrail-importing-a-codebase` | worker — existing codebase → first spec graph (derive + adopt existing docs + minimal interview) | `specrail-setting-up-a-project` + narrow self-trigger | active; unverified by use |
| `specrail-asking-user-questions` | concept — question rounds, options, inference confirmation, degradation | — (reached by name, rule 4) | active; unverified by use |
| `specrail-writing-specs` | concept — the spec quality bar (short / honest / on-rails) for every spec-producing flow | — (reached by name, rule 4) | active; unverified by use |
| `specrail-choosing-a-workflow` | router (root) — classification + routing for workflow-eligible work | — (conditional pointer from the always-on rule, rule 4) | active; unverified by use |
| `specrail-writing-workflow-skills` | worker — authoring checklist for adding workflows | — (self-trigger only, rule 4) | active; unverified by use |
| `specrail-shipping-a-pr` | worker — PR lifecycle (create with gates / screenshots / up-to-date sync / checks watch / review comments — phases as sibling docs) | `specrail-choosing-a-workflow` (root) + narrow self-trigger | active; unverified by use |

Statuses are honest per rule 14: the family was ported into this repo and no run has been observed
flowing through it here yet, so every row carries `unverified by use` until one has.

The family is open and grows from real use; candidates (research/spike, refactor, bug-fix, a composing
skill in the composer pattern with its stage workers, and **extending an existing spec graph** — the
dispatcher's accepted review/extend offer, today a declared no-workflow path) each get their own
task-spec when they earn their place. The concept role has two instances: `specrail-asking-user-questions`,
extracted per rules 3/7 when brainstorming and the setup trio carried drifting copies of the tool
norms, and `specrail-writing-specs`, extracted the same way when the setup trio carried three drifting
copies of the spec quality bar.
Meta-rule 4's entry model is in effect: at the start of new work the always-on rule — the managed
AGENTS.md block written by `specrail init --rule` — points workflow-eligible work at
`specrail-choosing-a-workflow`, which routes to today's family; already-routed work resumes, and
direct work bypasses the router. `specrail-writing-workflow-skills` (self-trigger only) and the
concept skills (reached by name) sit outside the routing table.

## Current limitations & gaps

The family's known debt, stated per its own honesty bar and tracked here until each item earns its
fix:

- **Rule 14 (verify-by-use) is suspended** — not currently a done-gate. The rule above carries its
  rationale; the family table carries the current per-skill `unverified by use` debt. The ported
  family has no observed runs in this repo yet: the skills ship as content into consumer repos,
  where use is observed but nothing durable records it here.
- **Extending an existing spec graph has no worker.** Partial graph → complete graph (a missing
  `architecture.md`, un-specced modules, stale nodes) falls between the two setup workers:
  `specrail-importing-a-codebase` refuses specced repos, `specrail-brainstorming` designs new work
  rather than documenting existing reality, and the dispatcher — a router — must not do the work
  itself. The dispatcher carries only the operational instruction (its "Graph extension" section):
  align to the user's request on judgment without a routing announcement, holding the
  `specrail-writing-specs` bar — the rationale lives here, not in the skill — until the
  `extending-a-spec-graph` candidate earns its place.
- **`specrail-writing-specs` overlaps the `specrail-spec-graph` skill**: both carry lean/honest spec
  guidance today. The declared split — this family owns the quality bar, the spec-graph skill owns
  graph mechanics (frontmatter, links, the `specrail` commands) — is convention only, enforced by
  nothing. As `specrail-writing-specs` grows into the home for the family's spec and spec-graph
  rules, the spec-graph skill's guidance should slim to mechanics — or the drift the extraction
  fixed returns.
- **Most of the family's candidates are unbuilt** (the candidates list above) — deliberate, since
  each earns its place through real use. Until then, work outside an existing route proceeds directly
  on agent judgment; complex decision-bearing work still enters `specrail-brainstorming`, while a
  future composer may own multi-stage pipelines.

## Per-skill design notes

Each workflow's steps live once, in its own `SKILL.md` — the authoritative wording. Each skill body
also carries its own degradation behavior (an assistant without a native interactive-question UI,
skipped or declined answers, a workspace with no pre-existing spec graph); nothing is configured here.
What follows is only the rationale the skill bodies don't state:

- **`specrail-brainstorming`** mirrors the discipline this repo applies to itself ("the spec leads the
  code") only when a change requires choosing scope, user-visible behavior, or architecture: request
  → validated design in a spec-graph `task-spec` → promotion into module SPECs → implementation. A
  fully specified fix, mechanical refactor, documentation edit, or configuration-only change bypasses
  the workflow. One cohesive review settles the design; acceptance criteria or an explicit design in
  the request already count as approval, and alternatives are compared only when more than one viable
  approach remains. There is deliberately no separate plan artifact; the spec is the plan. Before
  promotion the workflow loads `specrail-writing-specs`, closing the earlier quality-bar gap.
  Clarification is batched through `specrail-asking-user-questions` only when a real user decision
  remains.
- **the `specrail-setting-up-a-project` trio** was ported from the source system and adapted in
  place. `specrail-setting-up-a-project` is a **sub-router** (dispatcher): it inspects the workspace
  to classify (specs present / empty / code-only) — routing, not work, per rule 2 — and is reached
  from the root router, by self-trigger, and by a direct entry point (a slash command): the
  direct entry that justifies its skill-hood under rule 1's addressability test
  (`specrail-starting-a-new-project` / `specrail-importing-a-codebase` are likewise single-consumer
  skills justified by direct reachability when the situation is unmistakable).
  `specrail-starting-a-new-project` distills an earlier project-inception workflow — working-model
  inference, personal-vs-PRD routing, MVP-first elicitation, alternatives research, incremental save;
  board/progress-tracker mechanics dropped (no equivalent here). `specrail-importing-a-codebase`
  (net-new) reverse-engineers a first spec graph from code + agent files, interviewing only for the
  intent the code can't reveal. Its doc-adoption offer exists because well-documented un-specced repos
  were losing their own docs at import: durable declarative docs (never plans or process files) are
  offered in the interview round and adopted **in place** — frontmatter only, so say-it-once holds,
  the user's words stay theirs, and the diff is reviewable — rather than distilled into parallel
  nodes that would drift; adopted prose is corrected only where it is unclear or has drifted from the
  code, and every correction is flagged to the user. Adaptation touches were deliberately minimal:
  descriptions trimmed to triggers (rule 5), inlined question norms replaced by pointers to
  `specrail-asking-user-questions` (rule 7), endings made explicit (rule 6), the drifting copies of
  the spec bar later extracted into `specrail-writing-specs` (rules 3/7) — the flows themselves are
  untouched.
- **`specrail-asking-user-questions`** carries the family's question norms once: rounds, option
  design, the inference-confirmation pattern, and skip/headless degradation. Callers keep the *when* —
  and say where assumptions get recorded.
- **`specrail-shipping-a-pr`** was mined from real PR sessions: the recurring asks —
  verify-then-PR, self-review first, rebase on fresh main, screenshots for UI changes, "make PR
  up-to-date", "look at the checks", "do not fix review comments blindly" — became its gates and phase
  docs. One skill rather than five (rule 1): every lifecycle ask enters through the same trigger; the
  phases are internal forks as sibling docs. Its done bar (every existing check green + user told,
  never "PR opened"; a no-CI repo terminates as an explicit "no checks reported" state, never a silent
  green) and the review-only assets-ref screenshot default were explicit user decisions. Its review
  hardening converged on one shared discipline instead of per-finding patches — **observed, never
  assumed**: every finding across three review rounds was the same defect (acting on, or declaring,
  state not observed at the moment of the action), so the rule lives once in the spine — verify at
  the point of action, fetch remote state fresh and completely, poll indeterminate answers — and
  each phase doc instantiates it at its own action points (pre-push re-assertions after
  tree-mutating steps, body fetched before edit, `UNKNOWN` merge state polled, throwaway cleanup
  owned by the phase that made the throwaway).
- **`specrail-writing-specs`** carries the family's spec quality bar once — short / honest / on-rails —
  and is the accruing home for the family's rules about specs and the spec graph as they grow. Graph
  *mechanics* (frontmatter, link kinds, the `specrail` commands) stay with the `specrail-spec-graph`
  skill; this concept is the bar the workflows hold on top of them. Extracted per rules 3/7 when the
  setup trio carried three drifting copies of the bar (and the dispatcher — a router — carried norms
  it shouldn't, per rule 2).
